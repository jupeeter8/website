# Week 3, August 2025

Hello friends, I hope you all are doing great. Autumn is almost here and with it the realisation that
there are only 4 months left in the year and too many things in my ToDo list that I don't even know
when or how to start working on. Since each year seems to go by faster than the previous one and the
coming year starts with the guilt of not having completed any goals from the last year, I am thinking
of at least starting some of the things I wanted to do this year, even if 4 months are not enough to
finish them.  
Two of the most important things I wanted to do this year was start learning the bass and find a new
job because the current one sucks ass and so far I have made zero progress in either of them. This
thought is also a result of recent events at work, having witnessed the epitome of being biased and
a complete turncoat. It's only reasonable that I look at my laundry list and do something that assures
some peace of mind.

## Midday Shopping
Apart from thinking about things I'd like to do, most of my week was quite mundane. A rather
interesting thing that happened was at the billing counter of a grocery shop when I looked at the
eclectic assortment of items my friends and I were getting billed at 3PM in the middle of the work.
A Nescafe tetrapack, cocoa powder and a bar of soap. I'll let you guess what I got.

## Weekend is for overeating 2.0
So the last time we went to Boteco, DD could not join us and we had wanted to go there for a steak
for a while. It only made sense to visit it again, with DD and have more steak.  
My blood vessels will blow up from the amount of fat I have consumed in the last two weeks.
What truly is amazing is that we had to struggle for parking again this week, even more than the last one.
My friends went past the place three times in circles to look for a place to park, man driving in
Bangalore is abysmal. -1/10 please fix it.
