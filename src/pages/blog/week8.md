## Week 8, Sep 2025
### Slower Pace
Last week was restful. I did not do much. At least I didn't do things that annoy me. I have been
cooking more often the past few days. I don't know what happened to bring this change in me but I have
been enjoying it a lot. _"Very restorative" ~ Burt_.  
It's  also because I have become very
sick and tired of ordering food from zomato. (I don't use swiggy at all). Looking at same five suggestions
every evening is very unappetizing. It's nauseating. "Yes, I'd like to have the same biryani
with 50 times more oil than any reasonable person should consume for the third time this week. It's
not a problem." I no longer enjoy eating out. I have become desensitized to it.  
Though I have my problems with my food situation in Banglore, I also enjoyed the process of
cooking. I am the person with least amount of patience. Really. I need Mark to put a chip in my brain
so that I can have subway surfers anytime I have to pay attention for longer than three seconds. Regardless,
the 45 minute struggles have been _"very restorative"_, peak efficiency, peak focus.

### Nerds for the weekend
I did not eat them. I attended [IndiaFOSS](https://fossunited.org/indiafoss/2025) over the weekend.  
I have been coding for a while now, not a long time but a few years (since 2019). I have been very reclusive about it
though, barely spoken to other developers and hardly ever attended  devconfs or conventions. I
have thought about doing it but have always passed up the opportunity. I also started to hate writing
code shortly after I enrolled myself into corporate slavery and didn't care much after that. 
I do still enjoy talking to computer nerds. Computers are very fun and learning how to
manipulate them is a *craft* I really appreciate. If someone can tell me new way to do it I am interested

Roommate, yes that's his real name, (hhu[@thedivtagguy](https://x.com/thedivtagguy?lang=en)❤️), asked me to
attend the event a few weeks ago and I agreed without thinking too much. I sit on my ass on weekends
anyway. He was giving a talk and I would have enjoyed attending a nerd talk. That was my idea.
Little did I know that there would be more nerds there than just him. It was as if I had been airdropped
into a battle zone and now I have to argue with all these people about what is the best init system in Linux.
Quite overwhelming. I ended up enjoying it though. I met a school kid who had made his own language
and college students writing their own kernel from scratch and other dumb things. (dumb doesn't mean
that it is unimpressive. It means someone made it just for the sake of making something cool).
It reminded me why I liked coding, linux and computers in general.
Of course I roped in JFK and AK-47 and even though I know it's not really JFK's interest unlike me,
I grateful he endured it because of me.

### Starting a bucket list
I have never had a bucket list. If you pointed a gun to my head and asked me to name 2 things that I
want to do in life, I'll end up taking the bullet before I come up with one. 
I have never given much thought to what I want to do, small or big things. 
Sure I have dreamt of traveling the world and buying a very expensive car if _I become rich_ but 
that is hardly a goal. Which car and where will I travel? Also why am I waiting to be rich to 
figure out what I would like to do that is so dumb (actually dumb).

I have spent last 5 weeks trying to come up with at least one thing I'd like to do. I think spending
sometime wandering around and taking up a work where ever I find myself has always fascinated me. I just
never had the opportunity or really the courage to do it. I feel I have been given the former now, I
have decided to muster up some courage. I am not talking about traveling, I am talking about traveling
while torturing myself. I am planning to hitchhike (to an extent) around the country and reach a destination,
not sure which one yet. It should be a good touch grass experience. Maybe I'll end up having fun who
knows. This will also mark the beginning of my "_bucket list_". I don't really know what I'll add next
but at least I can sleep peacefully knowing I have one now. The trauma of not having a scarp book in
4th grade and not understanding why everyone had it would have become twofold otherwise.
