				<h2><mark>I write,</mark> not very well</h2>
				<p>
					I have recently started writing blogs. Social media is
					convinitent in staying connected. Unfortunately for me, I
					can not look past the algorithm driven content machines they
					are. Blogs seem simpler. Old school, ad & algorithm free and
					created by a human, No AIs were abused in making of these
					blogs.
