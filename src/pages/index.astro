						<h2><mark>I write,</mark> not very well</h2>
						<p>
							I have recently started writing blogs. Social media
							is convinitent in staying connected. Unfortunately
							for me, I can not look past the algorithm driven
							content machines they are. Blogs seem simpler. Old
							school, ad & algorithm free and created by a human,
							No AIs were abused in making of these blogs.
