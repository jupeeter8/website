The problem with _not having a plan_ is that things almost never work out the way you _somewhat imagined_
them to happen. That was my experience for almost all days in Meghalaya. I found myself in situations
that I was trying very hard to avoid. Things like riding in middle of nowhere through the jungle while it's raining.
Doing the same again with strangers after it's completely dark. Getting into trouble with local authority. Having to skip
places I wanted to see since I stayed up playing games all night with people I met. One failed plan
after another, even though _I had no plan_. I wanted to know who I should blame for all my troubles and of
course, it is me.

I was left awestruck exploring Meghalaya the first day with Harsh. It is such a beautiful place. 
"A picture is worth a thousand words" and I really tried to take pictures of the landscapes as best
as I could but none of them truly depict how beautiful it was really. We had some trouble getting
started on our journey the very first day. The plan was to go to the [Bamboo trek](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xfuDcFmmH5VE1UCM6)
but since we woke up late and wasted two hours
sourcing another helmet, we decided to do other things. I spoke to a police officer the entire time
my new friend was trying to get a helmet for me. I sipped 5 cups of tea while the officer and I spoke about
what I was doing in Shillong.

On the way everything looked like wallpaper material. Hilly, lush green meadows on either side as far
as the horizon. The clouds made it look like it will rain anytime (it did) but occasionally when
the sun shone through the slits of clouds everything shimmered golden. I had never seen anything like
it. It's a tragedy that I could not enjoy most of the views for longer than a few seconds since
we were on the move.

Choosing what I should do is a difficult thing, it gets really dark after 4:30 in the evening, so I have limited
time to do limited things. I always found myself wondering if it's better to just enjoy where I am 
at the moment or go to the next place as I won't be able to see it since it will be dark. With all
that in mind, I of course
insisted to go to the remotest place called [Pedam Falls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pJjpsemfdAvJ4TqAA), and since we had _no plans_ Harsh agreed.
With sunset almost approaching, we reached a very quiet village. 
Almost deserted. The only sound I could hear was of some kids
playing football in a distance and the chirps of crickets, the latter drowning most of the other sounds.
We trekked for 15 minutes and reached the water fall. The only problem was that we reached the top of it
instead of the bottom. We would have liked to go down and see the actual water fall but we chose to just
sit on top and enjoy the view. It's not like we had the time to do it anyway. We had to return only after
20 minutes.

No one told me how much more difficult it is to trek your way back up. I imagined that the actual treks (this 
one was not really big, 15 mins one way) that I had planned will really be the end of me if this baby
ass one is taking so much effort. 

Once we reached our bike it was already too dark and beginning to rain.
Seeing how there is nothing we can do to avoid riding in the dark and rain, we decided to have tea and
maggi from a small hut next to us. Honestly, at that point, after having ridden on terrible roads
for hours and surviving the smallest hike imaginable, maggi tastes really good. Especially while you
contemplate about going ALL THE WAY back.
I really loved the village. I could live there forever and I remember
Harsh saying the same thing.

Exploring the villages there is another treat, It's a really different life from the perspective of an onlooker
like me. Small kids waved at me as I rode through the roads. Old People sitting at
the door of their houses, looking at you. I often wondered if they are amused by the fact that they have a visitor
or if they are upset after seeing the 1000th one. At least the kids were amused, they would invite me
to play football which I always said no to. Biggest regret.
![Kids playing football on the side of a small hill](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week14/week14_football.jpeg "I would find kids of all ages playing football very frequently")
I visited [Mawphanlur](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gz6AR6VwwHgn96vo7) one day, I had planned to go to the bamboo trek but I woke
up late. Though my plan was ruined I was actually happy because bamboo trek is a very tourist place
and this village was so far from all the tourist places that I was sure I will not find anyone. 
I was right but my plan to be completely alone was also a failure since three kids decided to spend their 
afternoon at the same spot as I did. I wanted to be upset but it's their village and maybe I am intruding.
I don't think they were having the same thoughts because they wanted to know all about me and I realized
It's not so bad after all. I had fun briefly talking, I wanted to know about them too.

Shortly after that three kids (they were not that small maybe around 19 y/o) joined me")

Another favourite part of traveling for me were the people. I had never imagined that I'll speak
to so many people on the way. The guy who was telling me about his life, standing at the edge
of the door of the moving train and Josh along with the people I met in hostel, the few friends I made for a few days, it was all very fun.

When I was in Sora, I stayed at a very lavish camp, I realized that it wasn't a _camp camp_ after reaching.
It was a quiet place though so I was happy until a group showed up after which I was not. I thought
my peace will be ruined but It was so pleasant to talk to them, the thought I had earlier of being annoyed
disappeared. I loved talking to _Tota_, he was a part of that group. Very friendly. I pulled his leg a couple 
of times and then felt bad for doing it. We sat around a fire that I occasionally
rekindled while _M_ asked us difficult questions. I missed them for whole two days after they left. That is a lot
of moping for someone you spoke to for two hours.

Sora was the nicest place that I went to in my entire trip, It's a small town mostly settled along
one road that cuts through it. You can reach one end from the other in 30 minutes. There I met _N_
at my first and biggest trek of my life. It was 8 hours long. As someone who sat on his ass
and changed config files for work, this was too much. _N_ on the other hand was a seasoned hiker
and we roped each other into going to Krem Chympe.

Later she roped another guy, _S_ into this plan and 
two days later, the three of us, people who barely know each other were going to another very 
remote place to see a cave I know nothing about.

Nothing went according to the plan that day. We had to wait for our special car that would take us
to the place, We had to hike in the sun which we got to know about after we reached. By the end of the trek there
was no terrain. No footing. We just reached, somehow. I lost my glasses the moment I entered the water, only
to be saved by our guide but it was really worth the trouble. During the hike at a rest stop
_N_ said, "I am never making plans with randoms again" I think she thought we were pissed. I replied
by "fuck you, man". After looking at that cave, I wanted to take it back. It is the most beautiful thing
I have seen in my life (yet). Only the cave was fun though, our trip back from the cave was riddled
with same problems if not more. It got dark before we started our hike back because we waited for a car
that never came. I was happy though, I got to see stars because of the failing plan. I think I'll
forever remember _N_ and _S_.

I wanted to go to the bamboo trek the next day but I injured my leg in the cave so I had to spend the rest of my
days in Guwahati looking out of a balcony.


Honestly this would not have been possible if not for all the people I met and my friends.
_Roommate_ who supported the idea from the day I told him about it. _G_, _Y_, and _DD_ who let me crash
at their home. _Valkyrie_ who walked endlessly with me to show me around in Kolkata. The friendly 
woman in Assam who took me to a hospital because I could not find one. _AK47_, _JFK_ and _D_, 
who thought of giving me riding boots for my bike trip. The Aunty in
Bhadrachalam who showed me around the city for no reason at all. The old uncle at a tea stall in a village
in Meghalaya who somehow spoke hindi and was happy to talk to me as long as I was there. The list
is endless but these small things really added up in the end. Thank you.
