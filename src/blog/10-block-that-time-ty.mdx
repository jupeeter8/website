## Week 10, Oct 2025
Happy spooktober everyone. Hoping your entire month is spooky and full of calcium. I was complaining
to myself how I have not traveled much around Bangalore the time I was starting this blog. Now,
after 3 months, I have left Bangalore for the time being and I'm traveling for the next few weeks.
_Manifestation_.  
I went to Mysore that time, after complaining to myself, but that was a cope while this is freedom.
Since then _**A lot**_ has changed for me, or maybe I have changed and everything else has remained
the same but I feel like I am a very different person looking back just six months ago. I am glad
though, at least I feel happier. Everyone I talk to tells me what I am doing is great. I like believing
in that but honestly I am just scared of what I am doing. My last words to Roommate were "the only
thing I am guilty of is having fun" after he basically told me that my biking setup looks stupid.

### Third time is the charm
I went to Goa again during the first week of october. It was a long weekend and JFK and I had 
thought about doing a trip for a long time. This was my third time visiting it and every time
I go back to that place I end up having more fun. I don't think it's the company.
I think it is just me learning to let loose. I am caught up in my own thoughts most of the time
worrying about things that don't matter, or won't matter after a while. This time Goa for me was
"brain off" mode as Roommate called it. I didn't try to stick to a plan. I did not wake up my friends
at 7 in the morning after long nights of alcohol poisoning. I even agreed to go to a rave party 
and actually had fun lmao.

Our bus for had a rating of 1.5/5 stars and we reached terribly late. Five hours after boarding the bus
we were still in Bangalore. No wonder the rating is so low since you are supposed to be halfway to Goa
in 5 hours while we were 30 mins away from my home. The bus itself was funny. The conductor, who I 
truly believe should be in school (either his puberty is late like the bus or he was actually 15 which is worse), 
did not have any clue about what is going on and every one who boarded had to wait form him to figure out 
their seat. A dude sat with the driver all the way. This is what you get for booking late on a long weekend. 
Anyway we reached Goa, late but here are and we are here to party (I'll end up regretting this). 
Beer did not leave our side the entire trip. Shortly after reaching till boarding the bus back to 
Bangalore I was drinking beer. If we were not commuting or sleeping, we were drinking beer. I always
joked that I'll drink more beer than water once I am in Goa but looking at the colour of my piss after
the first day it actually might have been true this time.

Only exception was the second day of the trip, 2nd of Oct. Gandhi Jayanti, in light of which we stocked up some alc
that we decided to drink at the beach. It was really fun. I am sure the alcohol was making me enjoy everything a
little more but I would I have had a great time even without it. Drunk, I stood the shore for a very long time,
just looking at the waves and feeling the sand drift away under my feet. That was probably the most
peaceful I have felt in a very very long time. I wasn't even thinking about anything. I really felt
I had nothing to go back to. Of course we still had the alcohol and my friends called me
to have the last round. After that I fucking died. The Universe `rm -rf`'ed me for two hours. Normally
I would have been annoyed at myself for doing this but I am in brain off mode. We are here to party
and it's fine if I get wasted once every year (more or less)

I reluctantly went to a rave party as well the next day. every time I played GTA V I thought that the devs were lazy
and they didn't code the dancers in clubs in that game very well since they all looked like zombies. 
Being at that party I realized that people actually dance like zombies and the devs copied it
exactly in the game. Everyone in that party looked like an NPC. I was truly amused.

### All things bacon
When I was leaving for Goa, Roommate told me that I must join him for breakfast at
[Maverick and Farmer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P3xDYdce7uxEjxdD8), Ulsoor. "Block that time ty" I was told. I think he just wanted to properly
spend time before I left on my epic (epicness yet to be determined) journey. I agreed since I wanted
to properly spend time with him before I left even if he did not. I was worried about the logistics but it all
worked out well, I asked him if he is up for it the moment I was back in Bangalore and everything was
decided even before i reached home. We arrived a the place and I decided to have his favourite breakfast, All things
bacon. We sat on seats overlooking a football field where a practice session was going on. Caught each
other up to speed and talked about the food, sports, school and public transport in Bangalore. I always enjoy speaking to
him, I really get to hear his opinion on things and it's always interesting.

### Tree time, again
[I'll have to eat my words](/blog/last-day-of-school/#more-catching-up). I caught up with Tree again. She 
asked me if I could hangout and seeing how I'll be unemployed in the next two days and out of 
Bangalore on the third one, I had no reason to say no. I told her about my Goa trip and heard about 
her trip to Delhi.  
Bro is crazy. Since I last met her couple weeks ago she has had 
arguments with 3 people lmao. I don't know how she does it and how I have managed to avoid it for so long. 
I invited myself to her place that night to "indulge in experiences". She invited some of her 
friends over as well. It was a fun night It felt like I was hanging out with my school friends. 
At that time I was just thinking how far we have come, form being in the same school to being 
friends in Kota and now I am hanging out with her at an apartment that she pays rent for (well she technically didn't pay rent for that apartment but let's just continue with the narrative). 
It's strange and fun at the same time. So much has changed and I am somehow friends with this girl
who has arguments for breakfast according to her. She did yell at me for walking too fast the last time
I saw her.

### Last working day.
It was fun. I will really miss some of the people from that place, friends or not. I spent most of the day
just saying bye to people. I wasn't expecting anything for my farewell. I was just happy leaving the place
but lmao my friends were planning something under my nose and I did not even have a clue. I was surprised
by a small farewell ceremony (it was too formal to call it anything else). My friends said kind words
awkwardly that I did not know how to respond to but I am really grateful. Means a lot to me. JFK was asking
me if I would like to go out. I chose to chill at home. Going out is too much effort. AK-47 said he has
to meet his childhood crush and that he will join us in a while which amused me very much.  
![](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week10/farewell_cake.jpeg "Farewell cake and messages, like always picture taken after eating the thing")
Mf bamboozled me. He was out shopping for gifts that they all (DD, JFK, AK-47 and Champion) planned to
get me. This is beyond my wildest imaginations. I actually wasn't expecting anything. Not because they
are bad friends, but because they are such good friends that just having them around is more than enough.  
Because of them I am now a proud owner of riding boots, which I had wanted before starting my
travel but decided not to get. On top of that a vinyl record of one of my [favourite albums](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0OZMXDb6T5_gckJ3mziyyh6aNsiAgce) from my
currently favourite band. The latter was actually too much. Genuinely surprised me. I could not even 
believe that someone in Bangalore had that record and AK-47 actually found it. I just have to buy
a record player now. Can't wait to be back and own one so that I can blast some tunes. I have lost my earphones
so this is a great substitute.

### Yatra
I wish I had stayed in Bangalore for a while after my premature retirement but I left the very next
day for traveling. It was also the only way for me to reach home in time for Diwali if I wanted to
do this on my bike. I reached Pondicherry sometime in the afternoon of 9th. Zostel had messed up my
booking so I had to figure that for a while but eventually I was given a room.  
I saw two towels hanging on two separate beds when I entered my room. Looking at them I could tell that I
definatley had a guy as a roommate and the other one most likely belonged to a woman. It's weird how
I have started associating genders to the types of towels but its real. Girls and twinks really do 
use very distinct towels from guys. They were no where to be seen though so I left to explore by myself. By
this point I was doubting myself that doing a solo trip was a bad idea (9 hours into the whole thing lmao)
but it was fun. Pondi has some really dull beaches and streets to walk around but they were still
peaceful and that was the only thing that really mattered. At least they had a soul unlike "gram-able"
places of Bangalore.

When I got back I met with the guy, Shashi (I was right about the towel). He was also traveling after leaving his job but he
won't be unemployed like me. I also met with the girl, Anmol (I was right about the towel) after a little while. Very
interesting person. I think I talked to her the most during my entire stay. Her and the guy at the zostel
reception who messed up my booking. Well tbh she mostly talked and I mostly listened but that's awesome
because she really had some interesting stories and funny opinions. I spent most of my time with these
two people during my stay. We went for pizza night on our last night in Pondi. Roomate had asked 
me a few times what would and alcohol free party look like to me since most people just get wasted when 
they say they are partying. I can do it very easily but I had never actually been to one. I wanted
to show him this place, where people from so many different walks of life have come to just chill, 
have pizza, talk to each other without any intentions and be themselves without a drop of beer, though I
don't know if some of them were already tripping. I really liked that about Auroville. People just
chilling and doing chill things like living in a forest. For them it had meaning, I was just a tourist lmao.
It felt like a borderline cult tbh but it's okay. I'll give it a pass for now. It passed the vibe check

![](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week10/dog_pondi.jpeg "Dog at pizza night")

I also briefly met a couple at a place Shashi took me for dinner. His "spot". Very interesting people
lmao. The girl told me I should get high and visit the sound experience thing in Auroville lol. Next time 
maybe but really sweet and fun people. Talking to them for those 15 minutes was amazing. I would have
explained here what we talked about but I feel that will fucking boring to read and it's only interesting to me
but yeah, it's really amazing how you can meet someone and be friends for a day or two, as long as
you are in the same place and go separate ways after that. I had never experienced that before.
I was told to keep in touch but I kind suck at it. We will see.  
![](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week10/thespot.jpeg "The spot")

I made sure to lose my earphones and have breakfast at [Marc's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8SrsPe76A6mPYvn48) before I left Pondi. It is impossible
for me to do a trip without losing something and having good coffee. I saved both of them for the last
day. I caught up with Anmol one last time there. Talking to her is like talking to Roommate but
instead of computers, walkability, and public transport in Bangalore we talked about traveling, coffee,
future plans and public transport in Mumbai.

### Next up
I am currently in Ongole, lovely little place in Andhra. I am spending my next few days looking at 
cows and tobacco plantation. I was in Chennai the day before (12/10/2025)
mostly resting and chilling with a friend. There is a lot that I have skipped over, from Goa, farewell and even
pondi. I'll try to write more in the coming posts, though it maybe a while before I write again. I have written
this one over multiple days and across multiple sessions and I think I'll only procrastinate more until
I am done with traveling.

![](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week10/ongole.jpeg "Biking to Ongole")

I plan to reach home by 17th and spend some time with my family for Diwali. After that I'll be starting the
second leg of my journey, Traveling in Kokalta and Meghalya mostly. I have not decided what I'll
be doing after that.  
I am also working on a newsletter so people can subscribe to it for blog updates. I know
only 3 people use the RSS feed by looking at the nginx logs. I'll share the details with the next post hopefully.
Happy Diwali until then.
