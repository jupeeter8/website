# Week 1. July 2025

Hello my n-words (nice people). I seriously believe that only 5 people read this, but if you are one
of them, thanks a lot. You are the real **G**.  

Ever since I started this blog (last week), I spend too much effort thinking about what to dump here
and what not to dump here, and it mostly boils down to two things:  
1. Things I find funny and people won't  
2. Things I think people will find funny and I don't

So I have decided that I'll just write here things/thoughts that I find interesting regardless of
their humour index on my scale.

## Breaking Bad
This week, through sheer will, I finished watching the Breaking Bad universe—Breaking Bad, Better
Call Saul, and El Camino—for the second time.
I had been binging it on and off for the last two years, which started shortly after I came to Bangalore.
Every time I think about this stupidity, I remember my then roommate who would ask me to watch
Better Call Saul as well, and when I laid it upon him the fact that I had already watched it once,
he was very disappointed. He had that sad look on his face as if I had robbed him of the satisfaction
of recommending a song or movie to someone and they come back to tell you how much they have enjoyed
it. 

But I honestly don't care much about that geezer. I could not sleep properly for a single night
because he was always on call with his girlfriend, and I mean **ALWAYS**. I don't even know his name
because from the moment I stepped into the room, he was on his phone talking to her, and that went on
until I left. I could not even ask his name, and we spoke for like 5 times in six months I was with
him. Anyway, I am now at that point where you finish a show and your entire personality ends with it.

Not to beat the dead horse, but:

So I am up for taking recommendations if you guys have any, and I won't rob you of the satisfaction
like I did with my ex-roommate.

## Workplace and Weird People
When I started working, I thought everyone is sane and normal at workplaces and that weird things
don't happen. I usually don't interact with people that much, so I could not verify my conjecture,
but since my dear friend DD has recounted the tale of weirdos many times, I believed it to be true. But I had
my first experience this Tuesday when I walked to the other end of the room to one of the devs to ask
him about something. He and the guy next to him were engaged in a conversation, so I was waiting for
them to finish when the other guy turns to me and asks "Are you a misogynist? Look, the three of us are,
what about you?" while pointing at yet another guy. WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME THAT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
I don't even know what a proper reply to that is, so I just started talking about the thing I came for, and 
he says "Ye to kaam ke liye aya hai." Yeah, no shit, idiot. I am willing to give them the benefit of
doubt; maybe it was a joke, but I don't know, man, they were all in on it.

Another weirdo is someone I cannot refer to because of hierarchical reasons. Well, he is not weird;
he just refuses to use a single ounce of his brain. God has forbidden it. The world will be annihilated
if he uses his brain. Tsunamis 50 feet high will flood the entire earth. North Korea will nuke the shit
out of us. Aliens will destroy the planet into 50 million fucking pieces if he ever uses his intelligence.
It will consume all the energy in the universe for him to utter one coherent sentence. Am I being rude?
Yes, but I am legally allowed to do it.

## Catching Up With Old Friends
As you can already tell, my favourite hobby is complaining about work. Sometimes I think about how
recently most things I talk about that other people also relate to have become about work, and I don't
like this sad reality. Also, I am only always complaining about it, but I guess everyone does that.
But I caught up with an old friend, his name is Fauji, who complained more about his work than I ever
have, and rightfully so—he is in the Army. I met him for a brief period in Kota, but he ended up being
one of the people I really like and admire. He was always fun and always full of advice. He introduced
me to Hollywood war movies that I still enjoy today, my favourite being [Black Hawk Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265086/). I spoke to him after maybe 5 years, and he just ranted about his work. Did y'all
know there is no HR in the Army, so people can just beat your ass up and call you a donkey, and you have to
accept it? He spoke about how you always have to follow rules from the point you wake up until you
sleep, and there are probably no Sundays either. You work with the same people. You hang out with the
same people. The same people are your buddies, and you also party with them. That's it.

There were some things that I could relate to—for example, you have to agree with your boss no matter
how astoundingly stupid his idea is, but I think for him there are real things at stake. Man, if you
are reading this, respect++. I don't know anyone who could be doing what you are doing. Thanks for being
a good friend.

Thank you for showing me this.

## Song Segment
A few of my friends and I keep sharing songs most days, so I thought I'll share the song I enjoyed the
most this week here with you all.

## Walking in Bangalore and My Thoughts
While going to work this Monday, my auto driver almost hit a train of blind people being led by a man.
The irony.
It looked like they were all going to work, which was very inspiring to see, but it got me
thinking about the pathetic state of walkability in Bangalore and India in general. I hear my friends talk about
India becoming a superpower soon while people have to fight for their lives for simple things like walking.
The thought of Earth being destroyed into 50 million pieces is more plausible than India becoming a
superpower in my lifetime. People often tell me the two are not related, but they are in a way. If everyone
can commute (walking or public transport) effectively, it opens new opportunities for them. It allows
for the masses to be more productive, personally or professionally, which directly impacts the former.
It is a luxury to have a decent footpath in our country, which I have always only seen in richer neighbourhoods,
which says a lot about our society. Well, anyway, I was just sad to see that and really hope someone
knows how to fix it.

I also want to add here some work done by my roommate on the subject, which I'll be very happy if you
go through: [walkability-wiki](https://github.com/thedivtagguy/walkability-wiki). I think the
[website](https://walkability.wiki/) is down, so if you really want to nerd out, you can go through
the GitHub project.

### Patch Notes
- Images are now served through S3 so the website should load faster I guess.
