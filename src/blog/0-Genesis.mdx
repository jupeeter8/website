So I finally went to a _weekend_ getaway/destination thingy after spending **two** years in Banglore, 
I know, how dull, but more on that later. The major highlight of the week is this blog, the one you
are reading right now (hopefully).  

I started this because the lack of my mental investment in social media has led to people actually 
forgetting that I exist. More importantly I am **only** on one of them, Instagram, and when I download 
it once every 1-2 weeks, I realize there are texts that I have not replied to in a long time 
`-ve karma points moment`. Usually it's just the same two people but sometimes there is a text from a 
friend who actually wants to catch up. So I bought a domain where I could make a contact form for people
to drop me an [email](#contact) _(an email? eww what?)_ which has now turned into a blog. Yes this thing started
because I wanted an alternate contact page.

Besides spending most of my week trying to get this thing to work, I was also summoned by an old friend,
let's just call him Alt-smash, out of the blue since he was in Bangalore for one day. The only problem
was that he called me after I had reached home from work and I dread driving 40 more minutes but I guess
it's kinda stupid to make a blog to _stay in touch_ with friends and not go to meet a friend you get to
see once every year. We went to a place called [The Filter Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7h4QEt5avEYgDni87)
where we briefly spoke about what's up with him, and then I ranted about how stupid my work is for 
the remainder of our meet up.

## Mysore time 🕰🛵
I had been thinking how I have not been to any places around Bangalore, which there are so many of.
I decided I'll go check out Mysore over the weekend, see what all the hype is about. If you are in a hurry,
here is my review: 7.8/10 would go again.

The entirety of my trip was full of dark dull clouds which gave me vibes from this book called 
[What happened to regina that night?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23498851-what-happened-to-regina-that-night)
which is set in this hilly town, with dark clouds looming and mysterious past. Here's a picture to support my claim.

I also saw the [St. Philomena's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Philomena%27s_Cathedral,_Mysore) 
which looked amazing from outside but I was kinda disappointed when I stepped in because it looked completely different.

I was very excited for [Mysore Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_Palace) 
but that turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the trip   
a. Why do I have to go into the palace first and buy tickets?  
b. Why do I have to take my shoes off to see the palace??  
Nitpicking aside the whole thing ended in 15 minutes which is unacceptable.

## Car Museum
The last thing was the car museum, in the outskirts of the city. I am only going to say two things
about it, it should be renamed to car exhibit and the most interesting thing i saw there was this
bike in the parking.

Overall the trip was good, I would go to Mysore again because I think it has a lot of exploration potential.
