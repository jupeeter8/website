# Week 4, August 2025

Hello friends, I hope you are doing good. It has been pouring heavily in Bangalore for the last few days
and today is no different, makes for a great Sunday. I sometimes wish I enjoyed the rain now as much
as I did as a kid. I miss making paper boats and watching them sail down the streams
outside my house but lately, the rain feels like an inconvenience. My shoes that I forget to bring in get
drenched, I cannot go out to do anything and the traffic in Bangalore becomes so aggravating that I
start questioning my life choices that brought me here. Most of all, there are no fun treats that my
mother used to make when it rained. Why am I talking about the rain? I don't know, I just miss enjoying
it.

## Rakhi time
Rakshabandhan was this Saturday. I have always enjoyed meeting all my sisters during the festival.
They are so nice to me I almost feel pampered, but I feel that's also because I am the youngest brother,
I think? Anyway, I am very sad that I have missed
meeting them for the last three years on the occasion. It's not because the circumstances don't
allow it. It is because I am an idiot who does not know how to plan well. 

This entry is a note to self, to meet my sisters next Rakshabandhan. I don't want to forget what's
important in life. Thank you all for always wishing well for me and thanks for sending in all the राखियाँ

## Bikes, Catching up and Drinking Alcohol
I don't usually consume alcohol that much, honestly I find the taste absolutely disgusting for the most
part except for a very few drinks and beer. I sometimes try to convince my roommate to taste the few
drinks I like and you can immediately tell he does not enjoy it. The disgust is written all over his
face but I get it. I feel like I can relate to him when I am given alcohol, I seldom enjoy it and I am
always the last one to finish their glass.

This week was the complete opposite of my usual relationship with alcohol, I actually drank quite a bit.
I don't know why my friends and I decided it would be a good idea to drink ungodly amounts of gin in
the middle of the week after work. By the time we were finished, my body could not generate enough energy for
me to walk to my cab, which I cancelled after 15 minutes of struggling to get up. After a while just gave up
and fell asleep at my friends place. I am never doing this again. When I woke up at 6 I was already
regretting it considering I had a headache and had to go to work, having slept for only 3 hours.

Besided indulging in sheer stupidity, I also had the pleasant opportunity to catch up with a friend who I had not seen in almost a year.
We don't know each other that well but it's always fun to spend time with her. She always has something
completely absurd to say and I can't even tell if she means it or it's a joke. We spoke breifly about
work and life and hating corporate jobs.

Finally I accompanied DD and JFK on Saturday to get AK47's new bike. The one we had booked
two weeks ago. I would have been sad if I had missed it. What a milestone for a growing young man. He
got lost on the first day.

## Being Stuck, Moving On
Last week I was rambling about finding a new job. Today marks the first step towards that goal. I
resigned. I know, I know, this probably should have been like the 5th step but to me it felt like the
right thing to do. I'd rather do this than feel stuck and be afraid of what's to come. I don't even
know what's to come, like I said, I am an idiot who does not know how to plan well.
