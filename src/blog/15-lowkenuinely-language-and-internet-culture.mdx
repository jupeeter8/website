Gen-z humor has often been described as being weird. I think most people would
agree with that if they come across a meme that the so called "Gen-z" find
funny. I find it rather ridiculous to put people into social groups defined by
strict boundaries and it's also ridiculous to claim that their humour is weird.
It's one of those things that slightly older people say about things they can't
relate with and I am guilty of it. I am sure the rage comics and philosiraptor
memes were just as weird. I found those funny 10 years ago and I also find gen-z
humour funny.  But why is gen-z humor the way it is? Why is it so absurd, dark
and self deprecating and so much more strange than millennial humour?

Humor is interesting in the way that it needs to be unexpected and clever. The
punchline works because we were hit by something we did not see coming.  It has
some structure to it like setup, punchline, timing and all the other boring
things that unfunny people like to talk about but gen-z has thrown that out of
the window. There is no setup and sometimes there is not even a punchline.

It's also interesting because it's a quality (not of people necessarily) that we
appreciate and come across very frequently, almost everyday. These two things
force humor to constantly evolve, because a punchline is funny only the "first
four hundred times".

Modern meme culture has just taken it to an extreme level,
it's more than just sharing something funny online. It has
become the defacto method to share any idea - political, personal or
in pop culture. We have an entire generation of people that were born in an era
where being digitally connected is the norm. They constantly engage with each
others through memes. While this is great and clearly marks a generational
shift in how most ideas are shared on the internet, being connected with millions
of people also means that the mass adoption of "the new" is inevitable.  People
repost and reupload and recreate the latest trends at unprecedented rate and
this constant influx leads to a state of oversaturation where an idea that felt
novel becomes overused and outdated within days if not weeks.

"It is not funny anymore because everyone has seen it" is very real and because of
this the gen-z are pushing the boundaries of what is considered funny.

The punchline created by them are more abstract and absurd. Sometimes the joke is
that there is no joke. Sometimes a video is funny because a man on the internet
is telling me that I should drink after walking my dog and I can't tell if he is
being serious or trolling. This also relates to why "Dark humor & nihilism" is
often a part of this. It's not because the current generation thinks that all
hope is lost or edgy _is_ funny, though there are times when that thought
process is a reality. Gen-z humor still has a tinge of lightheartedness.
Millennial jokes about misfortune have a bitter edge but gen-z joke about their
misfortune as any typical conversation<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>. 

Maybe in a time when bad
things like world war, terrorist attacks and other unfortunate events of the
history have already happened, making edgy or hopeless jokes is a way to cope with
grim reality that the worse is not over with everything going on in the world
economically and politically, or maybe like the man telling me that i should
drink, the edgy jokes are also not serious. (the ironic humour)

Ironic humor is the epitome of modern meme culture and the internet culture as
a whole. It's not something new but it's more of a norm now. It basically revolves
around the ambiguity of the nature of the joke presented. It's about
enjoying cringe memes in the same way as you would a movie that is so bad that
it's actually good or rather, a meme is funny because it's dead now and it's
fun to share it again. The ironic cycle somewhat boils down to three things:

- Irony: It's not funny / It is outdated but it's being shared as it is actually funny
- Post-Irony: It's funny but it's shared pretending that it is not. What really is meant that it is in fact funny.
- Meta-Irony: It's unclear if it's funny or unfunny.

(I say funny/unfunny here but it can be applied to anything one sees online not just memes)


With so many possible interpretations of a meme, it starts to mean different things for different groups of people and as they mold
it further to represent the ideas they have, the same meme ends up taking a completely different form. The deep fried memes are
a classic example of this where initially the joke was the degradation in the quality of a picture as it's constantly downloaded and reuploaded
on the internet, it turned into random cringe shitposts. But why on earth am I yapping about all of this? Because of these two
headlines.

![slop has been declared the word of the year by Merriam-Webster](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week15/week15_slop.png "Slop has been declared the word of the year by Merriam-Webster")
![Rage Bait is the Oxford word of the year](https://theblog-static.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/week15/week15_rage_bait.png "Rage Bait is the Oxford word of the year")

Slop is a word that I did not even properly understand at the start of this year
but later I have used it often. It has become a
part of my vocabulary. Language is interesting in the same way as gen-z humour is
because there is constant need for it to evolve and people participate it in the
same manner as gen-zs do with their memes. It has always been forced to
change its form according to the needs of a time in history and community.
People have taken words and slowly changed their meaning to fit an idea that is
more relevant to them for centuries. I have previously assumed that it is also
because of imperfections in the way groups of people speak and write and with little to no means
of verifying the "correct way", words and languages changed. It maybe true to an extent
but I feel that's a false assumption because now we have more resources than ever to check how
something is written or said and language continues to evolve rapidly. 
Maybe there is no correct way to say or write something.
Just like a meme works for different groups who interpret it differently,
language works as long as it servers a real purpose and the
intended audience understands it. I mean sure all things can be named and maybe
there should be a word for everything, for example "A
black shoe, leaf of first apple tree and a blue car". It's a real thing but a
useless idea. When would I ever need to use it. "online content created with little
effort and use of AI" on the other hand is a very useful idea and "slop" is the word for it.
Some people argue that it's not a real word because it comes form the internet
but language is just what people use to communicate and digital culture
is how majority of the world now interacts with language. It's only natural that
it has the biggest impact on language and with memes being medium of sharing
ideas, gen-zs are the ones driving this change at a rate faster than ever before. 
So lowkenuinely is a real word even if my spell check disagrees, maybe it won't stick for long but for now
it is there.

This also raises a different question about the current political landscape
of India around language preservation. With more people online, and english slowly
becoming a part of everyday lingo that is constantly changing, what language are
we trying to preserve? Is it the one that already has so many words of foreign
languages that it's far from its original form? Is it the one that is spoken in
a different part of the country that sounds similar to mine but is also different, or
is it the one that we have already lost. Why stop here? We should go back to our
roots and learn cave paintings, or is that where people draw the line? I feel
it's too much effort spent trying to stop the inevitable. It's a shame that a
language I love will probably be gone in a few decades or century but that's
just it's nature. I will not fight against it.

Weird memes are here to stay and so is their impact on
language. If you are someone who says "I can't be bothered about it", you are deliberately
alienating yourself form the largest cultural shifts.
