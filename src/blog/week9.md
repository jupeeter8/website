## Week 9, Sep 2025
My time as an employed citizen has come almost to an end. Nine day from now I'll become useless to
the income tax department. I am very excited to be unemployed though. For the first time in a long
time I'll be just free to do whatever I want.  
A few months ago I was speaking my mother about growing up, childhood and her experiences. I was telling
her how, when I was still in my school days, the best feeling I used to have during that time was the
last day of the school. Entering the exam hall knowing that after a few hours I'll be free to do
whatever I want. It was such a liberating moment when the bell rang. Of course I did not think of it that
way back then. At that time all I cared about was endlessly playing cricket and football. Gaming on
my friend's PS2 and going to shady forums on the internet when no ones home. Looking back, those days
were some of the best simply because of how care free I was every day until the next school term started.
Cringe School. Anyway, I was telling her how I have not felt that way in a very long time and maybe
never will (we did not really know about the latter, neither of us have really retied). But I think
being unemployed comes the closest, at least for the time being.

Sad part is I'll miss working with my friends. It's strange to me that you are asked do something
you can not enjoy, but you meet these people while doing that work who end up becoming good friends.
Now I can't imagine working without these people. I know you remote working posers can't relate but
I am sure you have someone as well. Last Friday (26th Sep) was my _last working day_ with DD. I did
not think much about it. I don't know what to think honestly lmao. It is sad yes. Until recently I had
not attributed friends to workplace, and now that I have it's my time to leave. Sometimes I think that it
does not matter, I could have met anyone and they'd still be just as good friends but in reality that's
just a weird cope. We went out to have beers on friday to celebrate the fact that I am leaving or maybe
as a gesture since no one saw this coming and this is the least we should do as friends.

### Next thing
I have spent the last few weeks thinking about where I'd be traveling to for the next 30-45 days.
I have finally decided to go to Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Before that I'll be starting with Pondicherry
and Ongole (I'll meet my friends family there). Then I'll go home and spend some time there for Diwali
before heading to Kolkata and then finally into the North East. I don't know what I am doing. I have
traveled solo before but not to this extent. I have been planning this better than anything I have in
my life. Not sure how this will end but I am excited, I finally get to experience the time after 
_last day of school_  again, to some extent.

### More Catching up
I caught up with _Tree_ last Monday. For someone that I know lives in Bangalore and someone I have known
all my life, we catch up quite infrequently. Once every eight or nine months. I get yelled at for 
even suggesting that idea sometimes. It's 20%ish my fault though but we won't get into that since
The Blog is about me. She wanted to have ice cream and how could I have said no, we meet once every 
2 years. We ended up arguing over a lot of things (friendly disagreements) while I was devouring my
three scoop ice cream cup and she was politely having her single scoop cup. Having a friend
that you constantly disagree with is a good thing to have. It bring perspective. 
Anyway it's not a problem for me, I see her once every 10 years so it's fine. I think the next time 
I'll see her is 2075.  

Besides this I met _A_. Another friend I have known all my life but I meet him very frequently. _Roommate_
just showed up with him on sunday. They met each other coincidentally while having the most
posh sandwich known to man and then it was agreed _A_ will come see me. Crazy because I was going to
suggest him the same thing myself. It was great catching up and telling him about my यात्रा plans. He is
also traveling to Japan so that is great. More matcha for him. We walked in a mall, looked at expensive
watches and I listened to him explain me about half of the shops in great detail and about their products.
I think he will do great if he ever plans to work in US

#### MOW
Song Segment is now renamed to MOW (music of the week) because the former feels like I am running a
telemarketing thing.
